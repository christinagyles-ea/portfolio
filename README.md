# Title
Design portfolio for Christina Gyles

# Description
A simple design portfolio to detail my experience and showcase a handful of case studies. I started with a basic open source Bootcamp portfolio template, I then rewrote the template to accomidate my design.

# How to run
The Basecamp application is run through a CDM, so the application does not need to be installed through the command line to run. You simply run a live server through your coding platform against the file index.html, or view the file in you browser. This project is also hosted online through Git Projects here https://christinagyles-ea.github.io/portfolio
