# Design portfolio for Christina Gyles

# Description
A simple design portfolio to detail my experience and showcase a handful of case studies. I started with a basic open source Bootstrap portfolio template, I then rewrote the majority of template to accomidate my design. 

I'm a designer that prototypes in code, with the view to create interactive prototypes for usability testing. My code in that context is not intended for production purposes. This portfolio is my first design and development project writing producion code.

# How to run
The Bootstrap application is run through a CDN, so the application does not need to be installed through the command line to run. You simply run a live server through your coding platform against the file index.html, or view the file in you browser. This project is also hosted online through Git Pages here https://christinagyles-ea.github.io/portfolio
