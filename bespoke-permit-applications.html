                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Situation</div>
                    <p class="lead mb-3">
                        ‘Apply for a standard rules waste permit’ was an Environment Agency project, being delivered by DEFRA. It was a private Beta service that enabled users to follow a template of ‘standard rules’ of permitting for set activities, to create a simple to follow and quick to apply for ‘standard rules’ permit. This was initially a paper based journey that was now available online and through assisted digital.                     </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-3">    
                        As the Senior Interaction Designer in the team, I was responsible for creating and overseeing the interaction and service design for the service. I worked closely with the designers of connecting services and programmes to coordinate a strategic cross-services design.                    </p>                 
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Task</div>
                    <p class="lead mb-3">
                        I joined the team part way into Private Beta, when the organisation was looking to build on the ‘standard rules’ journey, to allow for more complex operations to be permitted through the online application system, through a ‘bespoke’ permit application journey.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-3">
                    A clear framework had been set out in creating an online service from the paper based ‘standard rules’ form, in breaking up the form questions, and turning them into pages in the online service.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead mb-3"><strong>Reframing the task</strong></p>
                    
                    <p class="lead mb-3">
                        I was keen to resist the ‘digitising paper forms’ approach, and reframed the context so that the paper forms were simply acting as a guide for research in challenging, and validating organizational requirements that needed to be captured into user stories, and fed into a user-centred design process.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p class="lead mb-3"><strong>The problem</strong></p>

                    <ul style="font-size: 1.15rem;font-weight: 400 mb-5">
                        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Poor user experience in the existing bespoke paper based service</strong></br>
                            The existing paper process exposed all of the questions and all of the requirements for all of the users in a long unwieldy form. The form  would often need to be completed multiple times by some applicants applying for multiple permits. Completing the form was time consuming and frustrating.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Paper applications were expensive, and frustrating for agency staff</strong></br>
                            <p class="lead mb-3">
                                Entering and processing the paper applications cost a huge amount of time and money to the Environment Agency. Call handlers would also get high volumes of calls with questions about the unclear application process or chasing application responses due to slow response application times.                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            <div class="subheading mb-3">Actions</div>
            </div>
            <div style="max-width: 7500px;margin: 1em;">
            <p class="lead mb-3">
                I had to balance the need for detail to protect the environment, with a simple journey for users. Bespoke permits could be anything from a slight variation on a standard rules permit, to a complex waste operation with multiple additional sections. To make sure we captured everything for the most complex instances we used the existing paper based form to guide us in forming the business requirements.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/permits.jpg" style="max-width: 800px;" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="Image_of_online_license">              

            <p class="lead mb-3">
                I worked with a business analyst and went through each of the form questions in detail with various stakeholders and operational teams, to remove as many requirements as I could to simplify the journey for the user. I grouped the existing application requirements into themes and wrote them into user stories. As a team we looked at existing service data, to understand what requirements were most often in bespoke permits to understand what areas of the design to prioritize first, and studied what types of users required them, and any issues in the existing formats required.            <p class="lead mb-3">
                I created design artifacts to help visualise the landscape, it’s challenges and opportunities. Visuals I created included:
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-3">
            In order to visualise everything I was learning about the requirements I made notes against the paper forms and put them on our team wall. To visualise the other bespoke research I expanded the existing design artifacts for standard rules, building in the bespoke journey including:
            </p>

                <ul style="font-size: 1.15rem;font-weight: 400 mb-5">
                    <li>service touch points in the as-is journey map</li>
                    <li class="mb-4">an as-is service blueprint cross referencing our research on user needs, pain points and opportunities against the end-to-end service journey</li>
                </ul>  

            <p class="lead mb-3">
                For each of the user stories I facilitated:
            </p>

                <ul style="font-size: 1.15rem;font-weight: 400">
                    <li>ideation sessions</li>
                    <li>codesign workshops</li>
                    <li class="mb-4">design crits</li>
                </ul>  

        
        <p class="lead mb-3">
        We had a huge number of user stories to work through to offer the most bespoke permit options. To visualize the task and aid collaboration with others, I put the user flow on our team wall to update as we went through the design and build, creating a paper progress checker as we moved through design and delivery.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/img/mvp-waste.jpeg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="Image_of_online_license">              

        <p class="lead mb-3">For each user story I worked with the agile team, and key stakeholders to understand the requirements and user needs, and then the Environment Agency, DEFRA and Gov design community to create joined up and consistent designs. 
        I worked closely with the team's content designer throughout. I created:</p>

        <ul style="font-size: 1.15rem;font-weight: 400">
            <li>to-be journey maps</li>
            <li>to-be user flows</li>
            <li>wireframes</li>
            <li class="mb-4">rapid prototypes</li>
        </ul> 

        <p class="lead mb-3">I worked with the content designer on developing additional flows and pages, adding to the common flows in the standard rules wireframes, making sure our versioning included a joined up end-to-end approach. I built on the existing ‘Standard rules permit’ code prototype, which was using the Gov UK Design System. I coded the designs, and the content designer would add in the content. I again iterated and version controlled the prototype, wireframes and design artifacts each sprint, based on user needs or design issues learnt in user testing.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-3">I found the biggest challenge in this project was balancing the ‘one thing per page’ with complex interconnected data sets. Ultimately what worked for a simple bespoke permit didn’t work for a complex one, so I would often be creating two designs and joining them together.</p>
            
        <p class="lead mb-3">The first would be the design that was the simpler user journey, and applied to the most people, and then there would need to be the option to proceed with more detailed information, or accepting it in another format to account for large data sets. This led to quite a lot of design work across an already long list of user stories. I was doing the hard work to make the journey as simple as it could be for each user.</p>
            

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Result</div>

        <p class="lead mb-3">The design work for the bespoke permit application resulted in:</p>
            
        <p class="lead mb-3">For citizens a quicker and simpler application process;</p>

        <ul style="font-size: 1.15rem;font-weight: 400 mb-5">
            <li>a simplified journey, that still accommodates for complex permits and multiple users</li>
            <li>a save and return feature, allowing the user to complete the application via a task list in stages</li>
            <li>no longer relying on huge application forms and piles of physical documents being sent in the post</li>
            <li class="mb-4">reduced duplication of work</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="lead mb-3">For Environment Agency staff:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.15rem;font-weight: 400">
            <li>reduced duplication of work</li> 
            <li>permit data more accessible and easier to manage</li>
            <li>fewer calls with queries around applications</li>
            <li>reduced the time and effort needed across permit applications</li>
            <li class="mb-4">reduced frustration and increased efficiencies</li>
        </ul> 

        <p class="lead mb-3">Overall:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.15rem;font-weight: 400 mb-5">
            <li>Improved the experience for the user</li>
            <li>Improved Environment Agency’s relationship and reputation with the public</li>
            <li class="mb-4">improved job satisfaction for staff</li>
